WHANAUSIP
=========

WhanauSIP was a project started as part of a Master's thesis.
(http://raymondcheng.net/download/doc/WhanauSIP-thesis.pdf)
The goal was to use a Sybil-proof distributed hash table for resource location in a 
P2P-SIP implementation, enabling IM, audio, and video chat that is resilient to 
censorship, eavesdropping, and forgery.

This code was copied from a private SVN repository and only contains
an implementation of the Whanau DHT (http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/whanau-nsdi10.pdf)
It is for all intents and purposes, a preliminary research implementation,
and was last updated in 2010.
